<GADGET_NAME>HashApass</GADGET_NAME>
<GADGET_DESCRIPTION>Hashapass automatically generates strong passwords from a master password and a parameter.</GADGET_DESCRIPTION>
<GADGET_COPYRIGHT>None</GADGET_COPYRIGHT>
<GADGET_WEBSITE>http://www.hashapass.com/</GADGET_WEBSITE>
<GADGET_ABOUT>This application is created from source provided at http://www.hashapass.com Given the same master password and parameter, Hashapass will always give you the same result. That’s so you don’t have to store your generated passwords anywhere: just come back here with your master password and the parameter.  Because the password generation is performed inside this very browser window using JavaScript, the master and generated passwords are never transmitted on the network, and they are never stored, either on our server or on your computer—unless you choose to store them somewhere.</GADGET_ABOUT>
