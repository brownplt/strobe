dataflow not performing well. ex:

- for (i=0; i < 4; i++) {}
  said 'i' is not defined.
- var a = 1, ef = 0, ...;
  //later:
  ef |= 5;
  says ef is not defined.
- var ret = '', i, e;
  return ret;
  //ret is not undefined!!
- String is a function that converts anything to a string.
  couldn't put it in the env cause it's a type name.
- Array is undefined, so "new Array()" doesn't work.
- String also has 'static' functions like fromCharCode.
- "i--" gives a "%prefixinc is not defined" error, wtf>?
- it uses "eval" =( =(. 
- "Hey".charCode() is valid, cause strings turn into
  objects. got to get that + constructors on the way.
